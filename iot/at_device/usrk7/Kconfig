    help
        Since USR-K7 only has pass-through transmission modeï¼Œ this driver
        depends on the AT Pass-Through support(AT_CLIENT_PASS_THROUGH).
        Because of pass-through, we need to switch the mode between command mode
        and transmission mode, so it currently can not work well with
        SAL(Socket abstraction layer), it will be fixed later. But for now, if
        you wanna use this driver, please reference sample program
        (at_sample_usrk7), and try "usrk7_io" and "usrk7_socket_setup" command.
